# BRCI (Brick Rigs Creation Interface) Rust Version (v0.0.1)
BRCI is a tool for the steam game Brick Rigs, originally written in Python, however ported over to Rust.
You can find the original library [here.](https://github.com/MrPerruche/BRCI)

## What do you do with it?
BRCI is used to generate a .brv file from code, a .brv being Brick Rigs' creation file format.

## Where do I get started?

### Downloading it
Start out by cloning it, either by running the following command in your terminal (given you have ``git`` installed)
``git clone https://github.com/AbsolutelyNotConspicuous/BRCI.rs``
Or, by using github:
1. Scroll up and click the big green ``Code`` button.
2. Click ``Download ZIP``
3. Unzip it (For Windows machines, while you can use Windows' unzip, try 7zip, it will save you pain on larger things!)
4. Follow the guide below!

### Setting it up
Currently, there is no more documentation/instructions for the Rust version, however there is still some information below:
Of course, you need an understanding of Rust. In theory, you don't need to know too much, but you need to know it.
